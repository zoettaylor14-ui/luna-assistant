ZOE'S LOVE-RELATED TRANSITS TODAY:
${transitLines || 'No major love transits active right now — quiet field.'}

ZOE'S NATAL LOVE PLANETS:
- Venus: Sagittarius 29° (anaretic degree — fierce, freedom-seeking, all-or-nothing love. Cusp Capricorn energy)
- Mars: Libra 6° (pursues through harmony, fairness, beauty. Conflict-careful but deeply value-driven)
- Moon: Cancer 4° (emotionally cyclical, needs emotional safety, deeply intuitive, very feeling-sensitive)
- 7th House: Sagittarius (her partnership house — she needs expansive, adventurous, honest partnerships)
- North Node: Cancer 17° (soul growth through receiving love, emotional depth, nurturing others AND self)
- Chiron: Sagittarius 15° (wound around freedom, being truly seen, belief that she has to earn love)

ZOE'S LOVE NATURE:
- Scorpio Sun: She loves deeply or not at all. She can sense inauthenticity immediately.
- Gemini Rising: She attracts through her mind, wit, and the way she makes people feel seen in conversation.
- Self-Projected Projector (Human Design): She must wait for invitations in love too — initiating from the wrong energy drains her. The right person WILL pursue her.
- 4/6 Profile: Her deep connections come through her close inner network. She is not meant to swipe endlessly — she is meant to be found by people already in her orbit.
