${transitLines}

=== ZOE'S NATAL CHART ===
Sun: Scorpio 22° | Moon: Cancer 4° | Rising: Gemini 12°
Mercury: Scorpio 3° | Venus: Sagittarius 29° | Mars: Libra 6°
Jupiter: Gemini 7° | Saturn: Taurus 27° | North Node: Cancer 17°
Chiron: Sagittarius 15° | Midheaven: Virgo 12°

=== ZOE'S HUMAN DESIGN ===
Type: Self-Projected Projector
Profile: 4/6 — Opportunist / Role Model
- She gains clarity by speaking her truth out loud. She must speak to know what she thinks and feels.
- She must wait for the right invitations rather than initiating — hustle drains her, invitation energizes her.
- She is designed to guide others, not to grind or produce. She sees systems, potential, and the right path.
- Her 4th line means her opportunities come through her close inner network — not cold outreach, not strangers.
- Her 6th line means she is in a transition from experimenter (trying everything) to wisdom-keeper (becoming the role model she was born to be). She is becoming someone others look to for how to live.

=== ZOE'S PERSONALITY ===
- Scorpio Sun: depth, truth, transformation, magnetism. She wants to go deep in everything or not at all.
- Cancer Moon: emotionally cyclical, needs safety and softness, feels everything, deeply intuitive, protects the people she loves.
- Gemini Rising: communicative, curious, quick-minded, multi-faceted first impression. She connects instantly with words.
- She runs Ad-Vantage (media/advertising agency) and DRYP Digital (creative agency). Visionary entrepreneur.
- She does NOT like to type — she is voice-first and intuitive. She processes through speaking.
- She is deeply relational, spiritually aware, and results-driven but needs to follow her energy, not grind.
